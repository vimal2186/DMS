# Summary of Work Performed (October 28, 2025)

This document details the enhancements and debugging efforts undertaken to improve the Document Management System (DMS) since the last major update.

## 1. Admin Document Feedback System (Human-in-the-Loop Training)

A new admin-level feature has been implemented to allow human feedback for document training, aiming to continuously improve AI performance.

### 1.1. Data Model Design (`backend/models.py`)
-   **`FeedbackType` Enum**: Introduced an enumeration to categorize different types of feedback:
    -   `OCR_CORRECTION`
    -   `SUMMARY_ADJUSTMENT`
    -   `CATEGORY_ADJUSTMENT`
    -   `TAG_ADJUSTMENT`
    -   `PII_VALIDATION`
    -   `QA_CORRECTION`
    -   `OTHER`
-   **`DocumentFeedback` Model**: A new Pydantic model was added to store feedback entries, including:
    -   `document_id`: Link to the parent document.
    -   `user_id`: The admin user who provided the feedback.
    -   `feedback_type`: Type of feedback (from `FeedbackType` enum).
    -   `original_content`: Original text/value before correction.
    -   `corrected_content`: Corrected text/value.
    -   `field_name`: Specific field being corrected (e.g., "extracted_text", "summary").
    -   `chunk_id`: If feedback is specific to a document chunk.
    -   `notes`: Additional notes.
    -   `created_at`: Timestamp of feedback creation.

### 1.2. Backend Endpoint Development (`backend/database.py`, `backend/app.py`)
-   **Database Collection**:
    -   `backend/database.py` was updated to include `get_document_feedback_collection` for managing feedback entries in MongoDB.
-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `backend/app.py` was modified to import the new `DocumentFeedback` model and `FeedbackType` enum.
    -   An `get_current_admin_user` dependency was added to restrict access to admin-only routes.
    -   The following FastAPI endpoints were implemented under the `/admin/feedback/` path:
        -   `GET /admin/feedback/`: Retrieves all document feedback entries, sorted by creation date.
        -   `POST /admin/feedback/`: Allows an admin to submit new feedback for a document.
        -   `PUT /admin/feedback/{feedback_id}`: Enables updating an existing feedback entry.
        -   `DELETE /admin/feedback/{feedback_id}`: Facilitates the deletion of a feedback entry.

### 1.3. Frontend UI for Admin Interaction (`frontend/app.py`)
-   **Sidebar Navigation**: A new "Admin Feedback" option was added to the sidebar navigation.
-   **Feedback Display**: The "Admin Feedback" section now displays all submitted feedback entries in an expandable format, showing details like feedback ID, type, original/corrected content, and notes.
-   **Submission Form**: A form allows admins to submit new feedback, selecting a document, feedback type, specifying field names, original/corrected content, and notes.
-   **Edit/Delete Functionality**: Buttons are provided to edit or delete individual feedback entries, with an edit form pre-filled with existing data for convenience.

### 1.4. How Feedback Improves AI Models
The collected human feedback is crucial for the continuous improvement of the AI components:
-   **OCR Corrections**: Used as ground truth to fine-tune or retrain OCR models.
-   **Summary/Category/Tag Adjustments**: Utilized for fine-tuning LLMs to improve document understanding and metadata extraction.
-   **PII Extraction Validation**: Helps refine PII extraction prompts and can be used to train dedicated Named Entity Recognition (NER) models.
-   **Q&A Answer Quality**: Provides insights to refine the RAG system, including document chunking, embedding quality, retrieval relevance, and LLM answer generation.
-   **General Improvements**: The feedback data serves as a valuable dataset for monitoring AI performance, identifying areas of underperformance, and enabling active learning strategies.

## 2. README.md Update
-   The `README.md` file was appended with a "Recent Updates (October 2025)" section, detailing the RAG pipeline enhancements and the newly implemented Admin Document Feedback System, along with an explanation of how feedback improves AI models.

## 3. OCR Debugging and Enhancements

Several steps were taken to diagnose and improve the OCR process, particularly for problematic PDF files like "PAN.pdf".

### 3.1. Debugging Features in `backend/ocr.py`
-   **Environment Variables**: Introduced `SAVE_OCR_DEBUG_IMAGES` and `OCR_DEBUG_IMAGE_DIR` to control saving of pre-processed images for debugging.
-   **Image Saving Logic**: Added code to `extract_text_from_image` and `extract_text_from_pdf` to save the `processed_image` to the `ocr_debug_images` directory when `SAVE_OCR_DEBUG_IMAGES` is enabled.
-   **Configurable Tesseract PSM**: Made the Tesseract Page Segmentation Mode (PSM) configurable via the `TESSERACT_PSM` environment variable, allowing for experimentation with different segmentation strategies (defaulting to 3, with tests suggested for 6 and 11).

### 3.2. Logging Improvements
-   **Centralized Logging (`backend/app.py`, `backend/ocr.py`)**:
    -   Modified `backend/app.py` to configure a central logger that outputs to both the console and `ocr_debug.log`.
    -   Removed the `logging.basicConfig` call from `backend/ocr.py` to prevent conflicts and ensure consistent logging.
-   **Detailed Upload Logging (`backend/app.py`)**: Added extensive `logger.info` and `logger.error` statements within the `upload_document` function to trace the execution flow, file saving, `extract_text` calls, and error handling.

### 3.3. Regex Fix (`backend/llm.py`)
-   **`re.error` Resolution**: Fixed a `re.error: bad character range \s-.` in `backend/llm.py` within the `extract_structured_info_with_correction` function. The regex `r'[\s-.]'` was corrected to `r'[\s\-\.]'` to properly escape the hyphen, preventing it from being interpreted as a range operator.

### 3.4. Troubleshooting Steps with User
-   Guided the user through setting environment variables (`SAVE_OCR_DEBUG_IMAGES`, `ENABLE_OCR_PREPROCESSING`, `TESSERACT_PSM`) and restarting the backend server to generate debug logs and images.
-   Requested and analyzed backend logs to identify the regex error and persistent OCR failures.
-   Requested and analyzed the `processed_pdf_page_1_PAN.pdf.png` debug image to understand the visual input Tesseract was receiving.

The debugging process revealed that while the regex issue was resolved, the OCR itself was still failing to extract text from the provided `PAN.pdf`, even with image pre-processing and different PSM settings. Further investigation into the Tesseract installation, language packs, or the inherent readability of the document for OCR might be necessary if the issue persists.
