# Modifications on 30th September

## 1. Search Functionality Fix

**Problem:** The frontend "Search Documents" feature was making a `GET` request to a non-existent `/search/` endpoint, while the backend only exposed a `POST` endpoint for semantic search (`/search/semantic`) and lacked a unified keyword search endpoint. This resulted in search failures.

**Resolution:**
*   **`backend/app.py`**:
    *   Removed the old `@app.post("/search/semantic")` endpoint.
    *   Created a new, unified `@app.post("/search/")` endpoint that accepts both `query` and `search_type` (either "keyword" or "semantic") in the request body. This endpoint now internally calls the appropriate search function (`keyword_search` or `semantic_search`) from `backend/search.py`.
*   **`frontend/app.py`**:
    *   Modified the "Search Documents" section to send a `POST` request to the new `/search/` endpoint, including the `query` and `search_type` in the JSON request body.

## 2. `KeyError: '_id'` in `start_new_conversation` (Backend)

**Problem:** An error occurred in `backend/app.py` within the `start_new_conversation` function, specifically `KeyError: '_id'`, when attempting to create a new conversation. This was due to `conv_dict.pop('_id')` being called when `_id` might not be present in `conv_dict` if `exclude_none=True` was used in `model_dump` for a `default=None` field.

**Resolution:**
*   **`backend/app.py`**:
    *   Modified the `new_conversation.model_dump` call to use `exclude_none=False` to ensure `_id: None` is always present in `conv_dict`.
    *   Added a robust check: `if '_id' in conv_dict and conv_dict['_id'] is None: conv_dict.pop('_id')` to safely remove the `_id` key only when it exists and its value is `None`, allowing MongoDB to auto-generate it.

## 3. `KeyError: 'id'` in `frontend/app.py` (Frontend)

**Problem:** A `KeyError: 'id'` occurred in `frontend/app.py` at line 712 when creating a new conversation in the "Chat with AI" feature. The frontend was attempting to access `new_conv['id']`, but the backend's Pydantic model alias returns `_id`.

**Resolution:**
*   **`frontend/app.py`**:
    *   Corrected the line `conversation_id_to_use = new_conv['id']` to `conversation_id_to_use = new_conv['_id']`, aligning with the backend's response structure.

## 4. `405 Method Not Allowed` for Chat Messages

**Problem:** When sending a message in the "Chat with AI" feature, the frontend was making a `POST` request to `/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages`, which resulted in a `405 Method Not Allowed` error. The backend's correct endpoint for sending messages is `/conversations/{conversation_id}/send`.

**Resolution:**
*   **`frontend/app.py`**:
    *   Corrected the API call URL from `f"{BACKEND_URL}/conversations/{conversation_id_to_use}/messages"` to `f"{BACKEND_URL}/conversations/{conversation_id_to_use}/send"` when sending chat messages.

## 5. Robust `_id` Handling Across Backend

**Problem:** To prevent similar `KeyError: '_id'` issues in other parts of the application where new documents are inserted into MongoDB, a consistent and robust approach to handling the `_id` field was needed.

**Resolution:**
*   Applied the same robust `_id` handling logic (using `model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_none=False)` and then `if '_id' in dict and dict['_id'] is None: dict.pop('_id')`) to the following functions:
    *   **`backend/app.py`**:
        *   `find_or_create_person` (for `new_person_dict`)
        *   `upload_document` (for `document_dict`)
        *   `register_user` (for `user_dict`)
        *   `create_reminder` (for `reminder_dict`)
    *   **`backend/database.py`**:
        *   `create_user` (for `user_dict`)

## Remaining Debugging Items and Recommendations (from previous `OCRModifications.md` and `modification_file.md`)

### Kannada OCR Recognition Issue

**Problem:** Despite Tesseract being configured for `eng+kan+hin` and having language packs, Kannada text is not reliably recognized, often resulting in garbled output or no extraction. Multiple attempts with different PSM modes and simplified pre-processing have not yielded significant improvements.

**Current Status:** The `backend/ocr.py` currently uses `--oem -1 --psm -1 -l eng+hin+kan` which was noted as "user-confirmed optimal but non-standard configuration" in the file. However, the `OCRModifications.md` also states that after extensive testing, the "Final Optimal Configuration" was determined to be `--oem 3 --psm 6`. This discrepancy needs to be resolved.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Standardize Tesseract Configuration:** Revert the `tesseract_config` in `backend/ocr.py` to the "Final Optimal Configuration" mentioned in `OCRModifications.md`: `r'--oem 3 --psm 6 -l eng+hin+kan'`. The `-l eng+hin+kan` part is crucial for multilingual support. The `--oem -1 --psm -1` seems to be a placeholder or an incorrect configuration.
*   **Custom Tesseract Training:** If standard configurations continue to fail, the `OCRModifications.md` correctly points to custom Tesseract training for specific document types/fonts as a long-term solution. This is a significant effort but often necessary for high accuracy on challenging scripts.
*   **Image Quality:** Ensure the input images for Kannada text are of high quality (resolution, clarity, minimal noise) as Tesseract's performance is highly dependent on this.

### Frontend 401 Unauthorized Error

**Problem:** The frontend is unable to fetch documents due to 401 Unauthorized errors because it's not sending authentication tokens to protected backend endpoints.

**Current Status:** The `frontend/app.py` has authentication logic for login/register and stores the token in `st.session_state`. The `get_auth_headers()` function is correctly implemented to retrieve this token. However, the `get_documents()` function and other API calls are not consistently using these headers.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Consistent Header Usage:** Ensure *all* API calls in `frontend/app.py` that interact with protected backend endpoints (e.g., `/documents/`, `/reminders/`, `/conversations/`, `/files/uploaded`, `/backup/documents`, `/faiss/clear`, `/faiss/rebuild`) explicitly pass `headers=get_auth_headers()`.

### Multilingual Search and Q&A (Resolved)

**Status:** The `modification_file.md` indicates this issue has been successfully implemented and tested locally, with `backend/search.py` using Ollama for query translation and `backend/app.py` prompts updated for multilingual context. This appears to be resolved.
