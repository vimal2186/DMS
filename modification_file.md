# Document Management System Modifications - Status Update

## 1. What is Done:

*   **Backend LLM Logic (`backend/llm.py`):**
    *   Implemented a regex-based post-processing step within the `answer_question` function. This logic attempts to extract Driving License (DL) numbers from the document context if the LLM's initial response fails to identify it, specifically targeting patterns around "DL No." or "Driving License No." and cleaning up common OCR errors like '0à³¬'.
    *   **Updated:** Added logging to `answer_question` to print the `full_prompt` and `llm_response` for Q&A debugging.
    *   **Fixed:** Improved Driving License number extraction by always using a regex-based search, making the feature more robust.
*   **Backend API Integration (`backend/app.py`):**
    *   Modified the `/qa/` endpoint's `question_answering` function to pass the `context` (extracted text of the document) and the original `question` to the `answer_question` function in `backend/llm.py`. This enables the new DL extraction post-processing.
    *   **Updated:** Added detailed logging to `send_chat_message` to output the `ObjectId` and its type for both user and AI messages upon insertion.
    *   **Updated:** Modified `get_conversation_messages` to log the `ObjectId` and its type used in the MongoDB `find` query, and removed the `import asyncio` and `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` debugging statements.
    *   **Updated:** Added `read_preference=ReadPreference.PRIMARY` to the `find` query in `get_conversation_messages` to ensure reading from the primary node for immediate consistency.
    *   **Updated:** Added aggressive logging to `send_chat_message` and `get_conversation_messages` to trace the `chat_message_collection` instance and the raw `find` results.
    *   **Fixed:** Resolved chat message display issue by removing `write_concern` and `read_preference` from `insert_one` and `find` calls respectively, and by removing the explicit `ObjectId` conversion in the `find` query to let PyMongo handle the type conversion.
    *   **Fixed (Chat with AI context gap):**
        *   Modified the `send_chat_message` endpoint to pass `full_context` (retrieved from relevant documents) and the user's `message` to the `answer_question` function. This ensures the LLM's post-processing logic for identification numbers works in the chat context.
        *   Updated the `ai_prompt` in `send_chat_message` to strictly instruct the AI to answer *only* based on the provided documents context and chat history, and to explicitly state if the answer is not found in the context, preventing reliance on general knowledge.
*   **Frontend Application (`frontend/app.py`):**
    *   **Updated:** Removed `import time`, `time.sleep(1)`, and `st.write(f"DEBUG: Fetched messages: {messages}")` debugging statements from the chat section.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Ensured all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.
*   **Pydantic Schema Fix (`backend/models.py`):**
    *   Resolved an "Internal Server Error" that occurred when accessing the FastAPI `/docs` endpoint. This was fixed by adding `PlainSerializer(lambda x: str(x), return_type=str)` to the `PyObjectId` type definition, ensuring `ObjectId` instances are correctly serialized to strings for JSON Schema generation.
*   **Environment Setup:**
    *   Confirmed that Ollama is installed and the `mistral` model is pulled and running, which is essential for the LLM functionality.
    *   The backend FastAPI server and the frontend Streamlit application have been restarted multiple times to apply changes and observe logs.
*   **Chat Message Display Issue (Resolved):** The core problem of chat messages not appearing in the Streamlit frontend is now resolved.
*   **PAN Number Extraction Issue (Resolved):** The issue with the AI generating contradictory information regarding the PAN number is now resolved.
*   **User Authentication and Trial Period Implementation:**
    *   **`backend/models.py`**: Added a `User` model with fields for `username`, `password` (hashed), `email`, `trial_start_date`, `trial_end_date`, and `is_admin`.
    *   **`backend/database.py`**:
        *   Added `get_user_collection`, `create_user`, `get_user_by_username`, `get_user_by_email` functions for user management.
        *   Implemented `create_admin_user_if_not_exists` to create an admin user (`admin`/`Vimal@350070`, `vimsyvimal@gmail.com`) on startup if one doesn't exist.
        *   Integrated `passlib.context.CryptContext` for password hashing.
    *   **`requirements.txt`**: Added `passlib` and `python-jose` for authentication.
    *   **`backend/app.py`**:
        *   Added JWT authentication logic (`SECRET_KEY`, `ALGORITHM`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `oauth2_scheme`).
        *   Implemented helper functions: `verify_password`, `create_access_token`, `get_current_user`, `get_current_active_user` (which includes trial period checks).
        *   Added `/register` endpoint for new user sign-ups with a 30-day trial.
        *   Added `/token` endpoint for user login and JWT token issuance.
        *   Protected all relevant endpoints (`/upload/`, `/documents/`, `/search/`, `/documents/{document_id}`, `/faiss/clear`, `/faiss/rebuild`, `/qa/`, `/files/uploaded`, `/reminders/`, `/files/uploaded/{filename}`, `/reminders/{reminder_id}`, `/reminders/{reminder_id}/status`, `/backup/documents`, `/conversations/`, `/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages`, `/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages`, `/conversations/{conversation_id}`, `/messages/{message_id}`) with `Depends(get_current_active_user)` to enforce authentication and trial period checks.
        *   Modified `create_conversation` to associate new conversations with the `user_id` of the currently authenticated user.
        *   Modified `get_conversations`, `get_conversation_messages`, `send_chat_message`, `delete_conversation`, and `delete_chat_message` to ensure users can only access/modify their own conversations and messages.
    *   **Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.backend`, `Dockerfile.frontend`):** Added `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` for better logging.
    *   **Render Deployment (`render.yaml`):** Created a Render Blueprint configuration file for deploying both backend and frontend services, including environment variable suggestions.

## 2. Why it was Done:

*   **Improved DL Extraction:** The primary motivation was to make the AI more robust at extracting Driving License numbers from potentially noisy OCR text, as direct LLM prompting was not consistently effective. The regex post-processing provides a more reliable fallback.
*   **Application Stability:** The Pydantic schema fix was crucial for the basic functionality of the FastAPI documentation and overall API stability.
*   **Debugging Chat Feature:** The various logging statements and delays were introduced to systematically diagnose why chat messages, despite being successfully stored in the backend, were not being displayed in the Streamlit frontend's "Chat with AI" section. The goal was to pinpoint whether the issue was with message insertion, retrieval, or frontend rendering. The latest changes specifically aim to provide explicit `ObjectId` values and types in logs to confirm consistency between insertion and retrieval, and to remove temporary debugging code that was masking the actual problem or adding unnecessary delays. The addition of `read_preference=ReadPreference.PRIMARY` was an attempt to force immediate read consistency from MongoDB.
*   **PAN Number Extraction Issue Resolution:** The resolution for the PAN number extraction issue involved refining the prompt in `backend/llm.py` to explicitly instruct the LLM to *only* answer based on the document and avoid contradictory or speculative remarks, and implementing a regex-based post-processing step for PAN numbers in `backend/llm.py`, similar to the DL number extraction, as a fallback if the LLM fails or contradicts itself.
*   **User Authentication and Trial Period:** To meet the user's requirements for a 30-day trial, secure admin login, and user-specific data access. This ensures the application is ready for multi-user deployment with controlled access and trial management.
*   **Render Deployment Preparation:** To provide a clear and automated way to deploy the application on Render's free tier, streamlining the deployment process.
*   **Chat with AI Context Gap Resolution:** The "Chat with AI" feature was not effectively leveraging document context for answers, leading to inconsistencies compared to "Document Q&A." The changes ensure that relevant document context is properly passed to the LLM and that the LLM is strictly instructed to use this context, improving the accuracy and relevance of chat responses.

## 3. What is Pending:

*   **Multilingual Search and Q&A (New Feature - Primary Focus):** The application needs to reliably understand and respond to queries in English, Hindi, and Kannada, even if the underlying documents are in a different language.
    *   **Observation:** The OCR (`backend/ocr.py`) already supports English, Hindi, and Kannada. The `mistral` LLM is multilingual. However, the search mechanisms (keyword and semantic) do not currently perform cross-lingual matching effectively.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Direct keyword search is language-specific. Semantic search might have some cross-lingual capability but is not guaranteed to be robust. The LLM prompt needs to explicitly guide it to consider all available languages.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   **Dependency Resolution:** Encountered `httpx` version conflict between `ollama` and `translators`. Resolved by uninstalling `translators`, reinstalling `httpx==0.27.0` (compatible with `ollama`), and then modifying `backend/search.py` to use Ollama for translation instead of an external library. Removed `translators` from `requirements.txt`.
        *   **Modify `backend/search.py`:**
            *   Removed `translators` import and added `ollama` and `typing.List` imports.
            *   Implemented `_translate_query` helper function to use `ollama.generate` for translating English queries into Hindi and Kannada.
            *   Enhanced `keyword_search` to perform searches using the original query and its translated versions.
            *   Enhanced `semantic_search` to generate embeddings for the original query and its translated versions, combining results for comprehensive multilingual search.
        *   **Modify `backend/app.py`:** Updated the `qa_prompt` and `ai_prompt` to explicitly instruct the LLM to consider all languages present in the provided `context` when formulating an answer.
    *   **Status:** Successfully implemented and tested locally. The application now supports multilingual search and Q&A.

*   **Kannada OCR Recognition Issue (New Focus):** Despite `backend/ocr.py` being configured for `eng+kan+hin` and `Dockerfile.backend` installing the necessary Tesseract language packs, Kannada text in uploaded documents is not being reliably recognized.
    *   **Observation:** A sample e-Stamp document with clear, machine-printed Kannada text was provided, but the system failed to recognize it. Logs showed that `pdfplumber` extracted English text, and even with forced OCR, Tesseract only extracted the English portion, issuing a warning about no text extracted (likely referring to Kannada). Tesseract debugging commands confirmed that Tesseract version `5.5.0.20241111` is installed, and both `pytesseract` and the Tesseract CLI list `eng`, `hin`, and `kan` as available languages, with `tessdata` path at `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR/tessdata/`. When `lang='kan'` and `psm 3` were used, Tesseract extracted 0 characters.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The core issue is that Tesseract, despite being configured with `lang='eng+kan+hin'` and having the language data available, is not extracting the Kannada text from the image. This could be due to the `psm` (Page Segmentation Mode) or `oem` (OCR Engine Mode) configuration, or a subtle interaction with the image pre-processing that works well for English but not for Kannada. `psm 11` ("Sparse text") might not be ideal for structured documents or documents with mixed languages. When `lang='kan'` was isolated, Tesseract extracted no text, suggesting that the image pre-processing might be too aggressive or unsuitable for Kannada when isolated, or Tesseract's `kan` model is not performing well in this specific context, or `psm 3` is not suitable.

    **Next Steps (Debugging Plan):**

    1.  **Test `lang='kan'` with `psm 11` (original PSM):**
        *   **Action:** Modified `backend/ocr.py` to use `lang='kan'` and `psm 11`.
        *   **Result:** The `raw_ocr_output` from the `/upload/` endpoint showed some characters extracted, but the recognition was still poor and garbled, similar to previous attempts.
        *   **Conclusion:** `psm 11` with `lang='kan'` did not significantly improve Kannada recognition.

    2.  **Test `lang='eng+kan+hin'` with `psm 3`:**
        *   **Action:** Modified `backend/ocr.py` to use `lang='eng+kan+hin'` and `psm 3`.
        *   **Result:** The `raw_ocr_output` from the `/upload/` endpoint was identical to the previous test (`lang='kan'`, `psm 11`), showing no improvement in Kannada recognition.
        *   **Conclusion:** `psm 3` with `lang='eng+kan+hin'` did not improve multilingual recognition for Kannada in this context.

    3.  **Simplify Pre-processing (if needed):**
        *   **Hypothesis:** The current image pre-processing (denoising, binarization) might be too aggressive or unsuitable for Kannada script, especially when Tesseract is attempting to recognize it in isolation or with specific PSM modes.
        *   **Action:** Removed denoising and adaptive binarization, using only grayscale conversion in `backend/ocr.py`.
        *   **Result:** The `extracted_text` from the `/upload/` endpoint with simplified pre-processing was still garbled and did not show any improvement in Kannada recognition.
        *   **Conclusion:** Simplifying image pre-processing did not resolve the issue. This strongly suggests that the limitation lies either in the inherent performance of Tesseract's `kan` model for this specific document type/font, or the quality of the image itself is fundamentally challenging for Tesseract's current capabilities, regardless of pre-processing or PSM settings. Further improvements would likely require exploring alternative OCR engines, custom Tesseract training data, or more advanced image enhancement techniques tailored for Kannada script, which are beyond the current scope of parameter tuning.

*   **Frontend 401 Unauthorized Error (New Focus):** The frontend is currently unable to fetch documents due to a 401 Unauthorized error, as it is not sending authentication tokens to the protected backend endpoints.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        1.  **Implement Login/Registration UI:** Add forms for users to log in and register.
        2.  **Store JWT Token:** Upon successful login, store the received JWT token securely (e.g., in Streamlit's session state).
        3.  **Attach Token to Requests:** Modify frontend API calls to include the stored JWT token in the `Authorization` header for all requests to protected backend endpoints.
