# Modifications on 25th September

## 1. `backend/llm.py`
- **Removed Duplicate Code Block:** A large, redundant section of code within the `answer_question` function was removed to improve maintainability and prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Improved "Father/Spouse Name" Question Matching:** The `elif` condition for identifying questions related to "Father/Spouse Name" was made more robust to include common variations like "father's name" and "father name".
- **Refined `answer_question` Logic:** The `answer_question` function was modified to prioritize direct retrieval of specific PII fields (like "Father/Spouse Name") when explicitly asked, before falling back to a general prompt. This aims to ensure that if the information is extracted, it is returned directly.

## 2. `backend/app.py`
- **Added Logging to `/qa/` Endpoint:** Increased logging within the `/qa/` endpoint to capture the raw output from `answer_question` and the final answer. This helps in debugging what the LLM is returning.
- **Refined Q&A Response Handling:** The logic for processing the `extracted_answer_or_details` from `answer_question` was adjusted to better differentiate between specific PII field values, JSON outputs (for "all details"), and general LLM responses.

## 3. `frontend/app.py`
- **Improved Q&A Answer Display:** Added a check to ensure the `answer` received from the backend is not empty before displaying it. If empty, a warning message "No answer could be retrieved for your question from this document." is now shown. The answer is also explicitly cast to a string to prevent potential rendering issues.
